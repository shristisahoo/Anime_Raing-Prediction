Business Recommendation:
- Watched has a positive impact on rating, production can focus on strategies to persuade users such that they conclude the anime.
- Anime that is being released on Movies attracts more users than anime being released on DVD Special creating a high impact on rating.
- Similarly, users are keen on OVA over DVD Special. OVA is the original video animation that directly reaches the video market, before getting broadcasted.
- Anime released on TV Special also holds more impact on users over DVD Special. Production Studio should focus on releasing anime in Movie, OVA, and TV Special in contrast to DVD Special.
- Users are more focused on anime that are being aired, so various marketing ideas can be inculcated for the ongoing anime, such that users are keen to watch them as soon as they are released.
